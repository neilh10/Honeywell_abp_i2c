# Arduino library for Honeywell's Pressure sensors I2C

  ABP series ~ tested with ABPMAND001PG2A3    

  TruStability HSC and SSC series (should also work).

  This library implements the following features:

   - read raw pressure and temperature count values
   - compute absolute pressure and temperature

   The example exercise_sensor.cpp
    reads the sensor and prints - CR to start
    optionally turns ON/OFF power
    optionally prints date
